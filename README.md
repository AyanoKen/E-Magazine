# E-Magazine
This is a web application which serves the purpose of an Online Magazine. I have built the magazine to show only the articles published in the current month in the home page of the website so, if the hope page is empty, please check the genre links in the nav bar to observe the placeholder articles.

The Website has a route which can be accessed to add new authors to the magazine or add new articles to it directly without the need of any web development knowledge to do so.

The website is currently hosted at the link: https://aqueous-badlands-19536.herokuapp.com/
